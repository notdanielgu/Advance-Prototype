## Introduction
I would like to make a product to assist the blind to walk, because nowadays the blind walk with a guide stick, and the conditions of the guide stick are sometimes a nuisance to the people around and the blind users themselves, so I thought if I could alert the blind to obstacles in front of them without touching the blind stick, would it be more convenient for the blind to travel?
